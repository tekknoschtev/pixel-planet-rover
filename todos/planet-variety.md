# Planet Variety & Generation System - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the current single Mars-like planet into a diverse planetary exploration system with multiple planet types, procedural terrain generation, and interactive discovery elements.

## Phase 1: Foundation - Multiple Planet Types
**Goal:** Create the basic infrastructure for different planet types
**Branch:** feat/planet-type-system 

### Tasks:
- [x] Create planet type configuration system
  - [x] Create config/ directory and planets.json file
  - [x] Implement js/planetTypes.js module for loading/managing planet configs
  - [x] Refactor createPlanet() to accept planet type parameter
- [x] Implement different planet materials (colors, textures)
- [x] Add basic planet selection UI (modal overlay)
  - [x] Create planet selection modal HTML/CSS
  - [x] Add planet switching functionality during gameplay
- [x] Create planet type presets: Mars, Moon, Ice, Volcanic, Desert
- [x] Implement different lighting schemes per planet type
- [ ] Add basic atmospheric effects (fog, particle systems)
- [ ] Test planet switching functionality

**Deliverable:** Player can choose between 5 different planet types with distinct visual styles

## Phase 2: Enhanced Terrain Generation
**Goal:** Make planets more interesting with varied terrain features

### Tasks:
- [ ] Expand noise-based terrain generation with different algorithms
- [ ] Add large crater generation system
- [ ] Implement mountain/hill formation
- [ ] Create valley and canyon generation
- [ ] Add boulder field placement system
- [ ] Implement cliff face detection and generation
- [ ] Create mesa/plateau formations
- [ ] Add terrain feature density controls per planet type
- [ ] Test rover navigation on complex terrain

**Deliverable:** Planets have varied, interesting terrain with natural obstacles and features

## Phase 3: Procedural Planet Generator
**Goal:** Enable infinite planet variety through procedural generation

### Tasks:
- [ ] Design planet generation parameter system
- [ ] Implement seed-based random generation
- [ ] Create planet generation UI with parameter sliders
- [ ] Add "Generate Random Planet" functionality
- [ ] Implement terrain roughness controls
- [ ] Add feature density parameters (craters, rocks, etc.)
- [ ] Create planet size variation system
- [ ] Add biome mixing capabilities
- [ ] Implement difficulty scaling system
- [ ] Add planet preview/thumbnail system

**Deliverable:** Players can generate unlimited unique planets with customizable parameters

## Phase 4: Interactive Discovery Elements
**Goal:** Give players reasons to explore and navigate the terrain

### Tasks:
- [ ] Add resource deposit system (glowing crystals, minerals)
- [ ] Implement points of interest spawning
- [ ] Create simple ancient structure generation
- [ ] Add discovery notification system
- [ ] Implement navigation challenges (dust storms, etc.)
- [ ] Create day/night cycle system
- [ ] Add environmental hazards (soft ground, steep slopes)
- [ ] Implement exploration objectives system
- [ ] Create discovery journal/log
- [ ] Add basic achievement system

**Deliverable:** Planets have discoverable content and navigation challenges that reward exploration

## Phase 5: Rover Enhancement & Progression
**Goal:** Add progression mechanics and rover improvements

### Tasks:
- [ ] Design rover upgrade system
- [ ] Implement climbing ability improvements
- [ ] Add speed/efficiency upgrades
- [ ] Create lighting system for night exploration
- [ ] Add sample collection mechanics
- [ ] Implement photo/documentation system
- [ ] Create progression unlocking system
- [ ] Add rover customization options
- [ ] Implement energy/resource management
- [ ] Create mission/objective system

**Deliverable:** Players can upgrade their rover and unlock new exploration capabilities

## Phase 6: Polish & Advanced Features
**Goal:** Enhanced visual polish and advanced gameplay features

### Tasks:
- [ ] Enhanced atmospheric and weather effects
- [ ] Advanced lighting and shadow systems
- [ ] Particle effect improvements (dust, wind, etc.)
- [ ] Sound design and ambient audio
- [ ] Advanced UI/UX polish
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Planet sharing system (export/import seeds)
- [ ] Achievement and statistics tracking
- [ ] Advanced terrain features (lava flows, ice formations)
- [ ] Multiple rover types

**Deliverable:** Polished, feature-complete planetary exploration game

## Implementation Strategy

### Incremental Development
- Complete one phase fully before moving to the next
- Test thoroughly after each task completion
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing save data
- Keep the core rover physics system intact

### Code Organization
- Create separate modules for planet generation, terrain features, discovery system
- Maintain clean separation between rendering and game logic
- Use configuration files for planet types and generation parameters
- Implement modular system for easy feature additions

### Testing Approach
- Test each planet type thoroughly for rover navigation
- Verify performance with complex terrain generation
- Ensure UI remains responsive with procedural generation
- Test edge cases in terrain generation (very flat, very rough, etc.)

## Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize tasks within Phase 1
2. Set up development branch for planet variety work  
3. Begin with planet type configuration system
4. Create simple planet selection prototype
